# Django rules

## Python Environment (pyenv)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses `pyenv` to manage the Python version. Ensure you are using the correct Python before running Django commands:

```bash
# From the repo root or backend directory
pyenv local <your-python-3.13.x-version>
cd backend
python manage.py <command>
```

When running Django management commands, prefer using the `python` from your active `pyenv` environment:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py test
```

**Never run `python manage.py` commands against a mismatched Python version. Use `pyenv` to keep versions consistent across the project.**

## Development Practices

- Use `python manage.py startapp` to create new apps within your project
- Keep models in `models.py` and register them in `admin.py` for admin interface
- Use Django's ORM instead of raw SQL queries
- Avoid N+1 queries with `select_related` and `prefetch_related`:

```python
# Good pattern
users = User.objects.select_related('profile')
posts = Post.objects.prefetch_related('tags')
```

- Use Django forms for validation:

```python
class UserForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ['username', 'email']
```

- Create custom model managers for common queries:

```python
class ActiveUserManager(models.Manager):
    def get_queryset(self):
        return super().get_queryset().filter(is_active=True)
```

- Use Django's built-in authentication system
- Store settings in environment variables and access via `settings.py`
