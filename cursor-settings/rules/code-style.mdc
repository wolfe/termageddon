# Code Style Rules for Termageddon

## General Style Guidelines
- No trailing whitespace on lines
- Use minimal comments that explain complex logic, not obvious code
- Suggest opportunities to unify code whenever possible
- Put complex business logic in the backend to keep frontend simple and focused on presentation

## Python/Django Style
- Format using Black (as per user preference)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Keep functions small and focused

### Binary Operations
- Put constants before expressions: `if (0 < length)` preferred over `if (length > 0)`
- This improves readability and prevents accidental assignment

### Comments
- Use docstrings for functions and classes
- Add comments for complex business logic
- Avoid obvious comments like `# increment counter`
- Explain the "why" not the "what"

## TypeScript/Angular Style
- Use meaningful component and service names
- Follow Angular naming conventions
- Use interfaces for type safety
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### Binary Operations
- Apply same constant-first rule: `if (0 < length)` over `if (length > 0)`

### Comments
- Use JSDoc for public methods
- Comment complex business logic
- Avoid obvious comments
- Explain architectural decisions

## SCSS/CSS Style
- Use semantic naming for colors with centralized mapping
- Follow BEM methodology for CSS classes
- Use variables for repeated values
- Keep selectors shallow and specific

### Color Naming
```scss
// Good - semantic naming
$status-published: #10b981;
$action-primary: #2563eb;

// Bad - color-based naming
$green: #10b981;
$blue: #2563eb;
```

## HTML Style
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper ARIA attributes
- Keep markup clean and readable
- Use Angular directives appropriately

## File Organization
- Group related functionality together
- Use consistent file naming conventions
- Keep files focused on single responsibilities
- Use barrel exports (index.ts) for clean imports

## Code Unification Opportunities
- Look for repeated patterns that can be abstracted
- Create reusable components and services
- Use shared utilities for common operations
- Consolidate similar functionality

## Formatting Tools
- Python: Use Black for formatting
- TypeScript: Use Prettier for formatting
- SCSS: Use Prettier for formatting
- Run formatting before committing changes

## Error Handling
- Use consistent error handling patterns
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Handle edge cases gracefully
