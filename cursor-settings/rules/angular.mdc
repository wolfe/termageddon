# Angular 17 Rules for Termageddon

## Architecture & Structure
- Use standalone components (Angular 17 architecture)
- Keep components focused on presentation, business logic in services
- Use SCSS for styling with semantic color naming
- Follow the established component structure: components/, services/, guards/, models/, pipes/, utils/

## Code Style
- Use constants before expressions in binary operations: `if (0 < length)` not `if (length > 0)`
- Use minimal comments that explain complex logic, not obvious code
- No trailing whitespace on lines
- Use semantic naming for colors in SCSS with centralized color palette mapping

## Component Guidelines
- Use OnPush change detection strategy where possible
- Implement proper lifecycle hooks (OnInit, OnDestroy, etc.)
- Use reactive forms with proper validation
- Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

## Services
- Use BehaviorSubject for state management
- Implement proper error handling in HTTP calls
- Use RxJS operators for data transformation
- Keep services focused on single responsibilities

## Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS classes with custom Termageddon theme
- Follow the established color system (termageddon-primary, termageddon-accent, etc.)
- Use semantic color naming: status-*, action-*, role-*, ui-*, notification-*
- Maintain Slack-like density with 14px base font size and tight spacing

## Testing
- Write unit tests for components and services
- Use Angular testing utilities (TestBed, ComponentFixture)
- Mock external dependencies properly
- Test user interactions and error scenarios

## Performance
- Use trackBy functions in *ngFor loops
- Implement lazy loading for routes
- Use OnPush change detection where appropriate
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking

## Security
- Sanitize HTML content with DomSanitizer
- Validate all user inputs
- Use HTTP interceptors for authentication
- Store tokens securely in localStorage

## API Integration
- Use consistent error handling across all API calls
- Implement proper loading states
- Handle network failures gracefully
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for API responses
