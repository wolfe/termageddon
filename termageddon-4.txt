Let's work on a collection of improvements to Termageddon:
(1)  On the review page, when an entry is opened and there is a version that would be replaced upon approval, have a section "Replaces" showing the currenetly active entry.
(2)  Change the approval workflow in the following ways; sort of like github change approvals:
  (a)  You can request approvals on your version by selecting users who should review it.
  (b)  You can continue to edit the version (w/o retaining history or creating a new version) during the approval process, but if it's changed approvals are cleared.
  (c)  In the review section, by default, you only see those versions you've been requested to review or which you have authored or which are edits to a term for which you have been listed as an author in another version.
  (d)  There is a checkbox in the search section of Pending Reviews, "show all"
  (e)  There is a separate action to "Publish" the version once the approvals have been completed. Anyone can click "publish" once approvals have been obtained.

Make changes to the backend, frontend, and tests as needed to support the above improvements.
