There are several problems with the implementation of the glossary-improvements-plan.plan.md

There are three Views:  Glossary, Review, My Drafts.  To the extent possible, they should use the same code w/o copy/paste.

When editing a proposed definition in My Drafts, upon clicking save, a PATCH is made with the original content, not the new content.  In Review, there is no Edit option, and there should be now that anyone can edit the latest version.  In the Glossary view it works perfectly.  This is evidence that the views are diverging too much.

The Version History is in the Glossary view, but not the other two views.  It should be in all three views.

Lastly, the Version History does not yet support viewing a previous draft and having it show up in the main panel, replacing the second section which often shows the Published Version.

Make a plan to unify the front-end code which populate these three panels so that all future changes, by default, go to all three.  You may have more questions for me about how other current differences which should be unified.
