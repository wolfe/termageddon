Here are some changes I'd like made.  Overall, there is no need to maintain existing data in the database; it can be wiped between data model changes.  You do not need to rerun e2e tests; I will run them myself.  But do run backend and frontend tests until they pass.

Change the word "domain to "perspective"
Change the word "expert" to "curator"
Change the word "version" (in the context of entry versions) to the word "draft".

In the application, the Glossary view is perfect.

The Review view should list drafts which are unpublished and which I've been asked to review.  Currently there is a bug where it's showing the same list of drafts whether or not the checkox is clicked, "Show all versions (not just relevant to you)".  Also, simply the logic to show only those eligible for review by you.  When they checkbox is unchecked, you see those you've been asked to review.  When checked, show all drafts.

Add a third tab (in addition to Glossary and Review, called "My Drafts" which shows your own drafts so you can monitor their review progress.

Like in github pull requests, anybody can change the requests reviewers, and they are shown under the Draft definition so you can see who has approved and who has not.

I think we have too many e2e tests.  There should be a few to cover the main flow, but mostly we should depend on the frontend and backend unit and integration tests.   Make a plan to right-size the e2e tests relative to the other tests.
