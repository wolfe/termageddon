Computer Science,sequence,"In mathematics , a sequence is an enumerated collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed and order does matter. Like a set , it contains members (also called elements , or terms ). The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the length of the sequence. Unlike a set, the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in a sequence, and order does matter. Formally, a sequence can be defined as a function whose domain is either the set of the natural numbers (for infinite sequences) or the set of the first n natural numbers (for a sequence of finite length n ). The position of an element in a sequence is its rank or index ; it is the natural number for which the element is the image. The first element has index 0 or 1, depending on the context or a specific convention. When a symbol is used to denote a sequence, the n th element of the sequence is denoted by this symbol with n as subscript; for example, the n th element of the Fibonacci sequence F is generally denoted F n . For example, (M, A, R, Y) is a sequence of letters with the letter 'M' first and 'Y' last. This sequence differs from (A, R, M, Y). Also, the sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), which contains the number 1 at two different positions, is a valid sequence. Sequences can be finite , as in these examples, or infinite , such as the sequence of all even positive integers (2, 4, 6, ...). In computing and computer science , finite sequences are sometimes called strings , words or lists , the different names commonly corresponding to different ways to represent them in computer memory ; infinite sequences are called streams .

The variable name is the usual way to reference the stored value, in addition to referring to the variable itself, depending on the context. This separation of name and content allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents. The identifier in computer source code can be bound to a value during run time , and the value of the variable may therefore change during the course of program execution .

As it moves, the forward edge of the molten zone continuously melts new areas of impure solid, while leaving a path of purer solid behind it as previously melted areas are cooled and resolidified; because the molten liquid phase can hold a higher concentration of impurities than the solid phase, the impurities of melted areas tend to concentrate in the molten zone and be carried along as it moves, leaving behind regions with fewer impurities.

Geology,hornblende,"An important rock-forming mineral of complex composition, essentially a silicate of calcium , magnesium and iron , with smaller amounts of potash , soda and hydroxyl . Hornblende crystallises in the monoclinic system and occurs as black crystals or grains in many different types of igneous and metamorphic rocks, including hornblende-granite, syenite, diorite , andesite , hornblende-schist, and amphibole .",Leo Schmidt
Computer Science,hash function,"Any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of a fixed size. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values , hash codes , digests , or simply hashes . Hash functions are often used in combination with a hash table , a common data structure used in computer software for rapid data lookup. Hash functions accelerate table or database lookup by detecting duplicated records in a large file.",Maria Flores
Physics,Bernoulli's principle,"In fluid dynamics , a principle which states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy . [ 22 ] : Ch.3 [ 23 ] : 156–164, § 3.5",Leo Schmidt
Geology,hemicrystalline,Having the properties of certain rocks of igneous origin which contain some interstitial glass in addition to crystalline minerals. Contrast holocrystalline .,Aisha Khan
Geology,Ma,"A non-standard but widely used abbreviation for one million (1,000,000) years, using the metric prefix M (for ""Mega"") to indicate a quantity of one million. When not otherwise qualified, it usually indicates 1,000,000 years Before Present (or 1,000,000 years ago).",Maria Flores
Geology,vergence,"The direction of overturning of asymmetric folds, which matches the direction of thrusting .",Evelyn Reed
Computer Science,run time,"Runtime, run time, or execution time is the final phase of a computer program ' s life cycle , in which the code is being executed on the computer's central processing unit (CPU) as machine code . In other words, ""runtime"" is the running phase of a program.",Kenji Tanaka
Geology,Bowen's reaction series,The sequence in which minerals crystallize from a cooling basaltic magma.,Sofia Rossi
Graph Theory,snark,"A snark is a simple, connected, bridgeless cubic graph with chromatic index equal to 4.",Ivan Petrov
Physics,magnetism,A property of materials that respond to an applied magnetic field .,Sofia Rossi
Chemistry,moiety,"Any named characteristic group, branch, or other part of a large molecule that may be identified within other kinds of molecules as well. Functional groups are typically smaller and more generic than moieties, whereas substituents and side chains may often be classified as moieties and vice versa.",Leo Schmidt
Chemistry,formula weight(FW),"A synonym for molar mass and molecular weight , frequently used for non-molecular compounds such as ionic salts .",Aisha Khan
Probability and Statistics,elementary event,"An event which contains only a single outcome in the sample space ; in a set of possibilities, a possibility that can occur in precisely one way. For example, when pulling a card from a standard deck of playing cards , 'pulling the jack of spades' is an elementary event (because there is only one jack of spades in the entire deck), while 'pulling a king or an ace' is not (because there are a combined four kings and four aces in the deck).",Samuel Greene
Chemistry,keto acid,"Any organic compound that can be classified as both a ketone and a carboxylic acid , by virtue of containing a keto group and a carboxyl group. [ 4 ]",Ben Carter
Graph Theory,order,"1. The order of a graph G is the number of its vertices, | V ( G )| . The variable n is often used for this quantity. See also size , the number of edges.",Chloe Dubois
Physics,wheel and axle,A wheel attached to an axle in such a way that the two parts rotate together and transfer forces between them; one of six classical simple machines .,Evelyn Reed
Biology,phloem,The conducting tissue in plants responsible for the conduction of food particles.,Samuel Greene
Geology,rudite,"A generic term for any of a set of sedimentary rocks composed of rounded or angular detrital grains, i.e. granules, pebbles, cobbles, and boulders, which are coarser than sand in size.",Maria Flores
Geology,aragonite sea,Contains aragonite and high-magnesium calcite as the primary inorganic carbonate precipitates.,Ivan Petrov
Graph Theory,clique,"A clique is a set of mutually adjacent vertices (or the complete subgraph induced by that set). Sometimes a clique is defined as a maximal set of mutually adjacent vertices (or maximal complete subgraph), one that is not part of any larger such set (or subgraph). A k -clique is a clique of order k . The clique number ω ( G ) of a graph G is the order of its largest clique. The clique graph of a graph G is the intersection graph of the maximal cliques in G . See also biclique , a complete bipartite subgraph.",Leo Schmidt
Biology,biomathematics,The theoretical use of mathematical models and abstractions of living systems to understand and predict biological problems.,Leo Schmidt
Chemistry,carbide,"A class of interstitial compounds composed of carbon bonded to a particular metal (usually a large-radius transition metal ) in a densely packed crystal lattice, where the carbon atoms occupy interstices between the metal atoms; e.g. tungsten carbide (WC).",Aisha Khan
