Repair bug whereby filter box doesn't work on the Review and My Drafts pages.

If you click edit on an Entry, and you have a draft in progress, load the content of the draft; add a notification that there is a draft in progress

Reserve a portion of the header for notifications; use that space for alerts that do not need dismissing.  Notification stays up for a fixed amount of time, try 5 seconds.

For those alerts that require confirmation or cancel, create a confirmation popup widget rather than the native browser alert

In the dialog we need a selector for entries.
