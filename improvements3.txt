Selecting a Draft from the History sidebar in the Review fails to populate the history section in the main panel.
When I edit an item in the Review, the latest version is still showing Approved by based on an old version.
Show history doesn't show any history in the My Drafts
The avatars on comments are empty and the the name shows as "Unknown User"
The Post Comment button on comments is messed up on the My Drafts section.  The button doesn't work and the button has no text and is small.
Again, any time there is a bug in one of the three panels, "Glossary", "Review", and "My Drafts", and the bug does not exist in another panel, it suggests a failure to use common code and rely on copy/pasta.  We should centralize logic in one place to the extent possible.
