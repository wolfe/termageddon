GENERAL CURSOR GUIDANCE:

Always maintain working unit and integration tests.

Do not leave whitespace at ends of lines.

Use minimal comments which do not read me the code, but help explain confusing or complex logic.

Try to put complex business logic in the backend to keep the frontend as simple as possible and focused on presentation.

We will not write any e2e tests at this stage.

Feel free to open a web browser to localhost ports as needed to view the frontend.  If the MCP Server isn't usable, please let me know to enable it for you.
