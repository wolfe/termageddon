GENERAL CURSOR GUIDANCE:

TESTING:
    Always maintain working unit and integration tests.  Don't write any e2e tests.

COMMENTS and WHITESPACE:
     Do not leave whitespace at ends of lines.
     Use minimal comments which do not read me the code, but help explain confusing or complex logic.
     Try to put complex business logic in the backend to keep the frontend as simple as possible and focused on presentation.

CODE STYLE:
     I prefer to put constants before expressions in binary operations.  For example, if (0 < length) is preferred over if (length > 0).
     When naming colours in SCSS, use semantic naming and have the mapping from semantic colour names to a color palette centralized.
     Suggest oppportunities to unify code whenever possible.

YOU MAY:
    Feel free to open a web browser to localhost ports as needed to view the frontend.  If the MCP Server isn't usable, please ask me to enable it for you.
