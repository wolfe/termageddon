- I erred in the Official term marking --- it's the version that is official.  Let's change the word to "endorsed" (implying that the definition is endorsed by a domain expert) and associate the marking with the version.  As with all changes, there is no need to migrate old data.

- If you are viewing a published definition in a domain for which you are a domain expert, you are able to click "endorse".  The button for others is disabled.  On hover, if enabled a tooltip indicates, "Endorse this definition as a domain expert".  If you aren't a domain expert, the button tooltip indicates, "Only domain experts can endorse".

- When viewing the Glossary, you only see published versions.  There is no need for Pending, Approved indications, nor a need for statuses filtering.

- All terms with multiple domains should be shown together.  Add the domains as additional rounded text bubbles.

- When selecting a term, you can select the bubble to jump straight to the definition for that domain.  If you select the term itself, you see the definition for the first domain listed for now.

- When viewing a term with multiple domains, you can switch between domains to see the various definitions using a tabbed menu the width of the tabs is limited and might only show the prefix of the domain (about 10 characters or so?) and on hover you see the full name as a tooltip.

- Always when hovering over a domain indicator, you can see a tooltip with the full domain name and description.
