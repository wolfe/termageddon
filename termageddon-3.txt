The statement of work based off of termageddon-2.txt looks good.  I've
decided on having Cursor write the frontend and backend at the same
time based on that initial statement of work.

Let's expand on the statement of work to accomodate the frontend development.

Use colors but no other styling from https://www.termageddon.com/

In general, I prefer a reasonably dense UI for most activities; i.e., small but readable fonts, not a ton of whitespace.  The density of slack.com is about right.

Please prepare any other questions that would help you figure out how the UI should look.  Also, please prepare a statement of work that includes all necessary Unit and integration testing of the backend and frontend and makes clear that the agent should do the testing while writing the code.

Use the latest stable versions of Angular and Django.

The WYSIWYG editor should support two sets of links, one an arbitrary URL, the other a link to another entry with two different icons.

There is a directory test_data.csv to pre-populate some glossary items.
